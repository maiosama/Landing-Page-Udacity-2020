# Landing-Page-Udacity-2020
First project in the Web Development Professional Track.
this project was created by using the start-up HTML and CSS of the landing project. the DOM of the HTML was modified using Javascript.<br>
I used javascript to:\n
1-Create unordered list items of the sections in the page, and append this list to the main navigation bar in the top of the page.\n
2- highlight the li item when hover over it, and if it is clicked the page will get thesection in the viewport.\n
3- set active class to the section in the viewport.\n
4- add a back to top button which appears after strting to scroll the page.\n
5- hide the navigation bar while scrolling the page.
