# Landing-Page-Udacity-2020
First project in the Web Development Professional Track.

<strong><em>About the project:</em></strong><br>
this project was created by using the start-up HTML and CSS of the landing project https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019 <br>
the DOM of the HTML was modified using Javascript.<br>
<br>
<strong><em>Modifications</em></strong><br>
I used javascript to:<br>
1-Create unordered list items of the sections on the page, and append this list to the main navigation bar at the top of the page..<br>
2- highlight the li item when hover over it, and if it is clicked the page will get the section in the viewport.<br>
3- set active class to the section in the viewport.<br>
4- add a back-to-top button that appears after starting to scroll the page, and then click on the button, the page scrolled smoothly to the top.<br>
5- hide the navigation bar while scrolling the page using jquery.<br>
6-the modification on the highlight navigation bar was done by CSS.<br>
 
 <strong><em>Refrences</em></strong> <br>
 I used the W3S website as the main refrence https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp, also the documentation of MDN was a greate help https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/, and the geeks for geeks website https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/.<br>
 <br>
 <strong><em> Important Files:</em></strong><br>
 1- the index file: the main HTML file which includes 5 section, the link to the CSS style sheet, the link to the jquery library in the head tag, and the javascript link in the end of the body tag.<br>
 2- the CSS folder wich contains the CSS file for the styling codes used in the HTML file.<br>
 3- the javascript file which contains the used functions and methods to the interactive and responsive behavior of the HTML file.
